The Australian market is new so they have asked me to let anyone here in Australia know about WritersDomain.net as they'll need to grow the market very quickly.  There is no cap on the number of articles you write.  They'll start you with short articles at the $17.50 range and as you prove yourself, you will be able to get more $40 articles.  Once you get the hang of how it works, you should be able to write 2-3 articles an hour which can prove really profitable, especially if you're in college or trying to make more on the side.  While the website can be a little wonky, it is completely legit and I highly recommend it.  Here is a bit about it....\n\nWritersDomain.net is looking for casual writers to write blogs and articles.  You'll be able to write these articles on your own time, from home.  Once you sign up at WritersDomain.net and are approved as a writer, you'll see a list of available subjects.  You have a given amount of time to work on that writing project once you've added it to your cue.  When you complete your article, it will go to an editor.  You have three tries to write an article up to their standards before the article is released from your name and up for grabs for anyone to write on again.  However, at that point you can \"capture\" the assignment again and give it another go.\n\nBlogs and articles range from 400-600 words and pay $17.50-$40AUS per article!  Payments are sent via PayPal and the PayPal transaction fees are covered (but not any exchange rate as it'll come in $15-$38USD).  WritersDomain sends your payment once per month or every time you reach $100 (which can easily be done each day).\n\nRegistration is simple and straightforward: just go to www.WritersDomain.net and apply. Here, you will be prompted for a writing sample.\n\nAdditional details are also found on the website, including writing guidelines, a FAQ, and a blog.\n\nGood luck! \n\n",
