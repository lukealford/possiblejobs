# possiblejobs
I got sick of visiting multiple sites to view jobs, so I built this, it scrapes, dribble jobs, all reddit jobs & /r/aujobs because those are my most visited sites, each scrape saves directly to a json file & the front-end consumes that.


backend built with Nodejs using 

[x-ray](https://www.npmjs.com/package/x-ray),[express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) & [log-timestamp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/log-timestamp)

and for the front-end

[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) & [Bootstrap v4](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/)
